    <string name="walk_header2_1">
        Walking is the most popular form of exercise among older adults and it’s a great choice.
    </string>

    <string name="walk_text1">
        If it’s been a long time since you exercised, you may want to start out slowly. You can start with
        just 5 minutes and build up to the recommended 30 minutes a day. Your goal should be to get up to
        taking 100 steps a minute. Remember, the most important thing is to just get started.
    </string>

    <string name="walk_header3_1">What can walking do for you? </string>

    <string name="walk_list1">
        <li>strengthen muscles</li>\n
        <li>help prevent weight gain</li>\n
        <li>lower risks of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and osteoporosis</li>\n
        <li>improve balance</li>\n
        <li>lower the likelihood of falling</li>
    </string>

    <string name="walk_header1_1">Take These Steps to Get Walking</string>

    <string name="walk_header2_2">Join a walking program or walk with a buddy</string>

    <string name="walk_text2">
        Chances are you’ll stick with a walking program if you have someone to walk with. Some shopping malls or town parks may
        have these programs. The National Institute on Aging’s Go4Life campaign has many resources for walking and other kinds of physical
        activity (https://go4life.nia.nih.gov/).
    </string>

    <string name="walk_header2_3">Wear the right shoes</string>

    <string name="walk_text3">
        Comfortable sneakers work well for most people. If you have foot problems, you may want to look into orthopedic shoes or
        talk to your healthcare provider about how you can continue your walking program.
    </string>

    <string name="walk_header2_4">Don’t let a cane or walker stop you</string>

    <string name="walk_text4">
        It’s OK to use your cane or walker if you already have one. These can improve your balance and help take the load off painful joints.
    </string>

    <string name="walk_header2_5">Aim for the right pace</string>

    <string name="walk_text5">
        Try to walk as fast as you can, but still be able to chat with a friend while walking. Aim to work as hard as you do when you
        climb up the stairs.
    </string>

    <string name="walk_header2_6">Talk to your healthcare provider if you have any problems</string>

    <string name="walk_text6">
        Tell your healthcare provider if you have any pain or problems walking. Otherwise, don’t let a health problem keep you from
        getting started. You may feel a little stiff and achy as you start walking, but many people feel better once they start moving!

    <string name="walk_header1_2">3 Tips for Safe Walking</string>

    <string name="walk_header2_7">Be Aware of Your Surroundings</string>

    <string name="walk_text7">
        Plan to walk during the daytime or in well-lit areas in the evenings. Keep an eye out for uneven surfaces, possible obstacles,
        and other tripping hazards.
    </string>

    <string name="walk_header2_8">Keep Hydrated</string>

    <string name="walk_text8">
        Bring a bottle of water (or other low-calorie liquid) with you and be sure to drink plenty of fluids if you sweat.
    </string>

    <string name="walk_header2_9">Dress Properly for the Weather</string>

    <string name="walk_text9">
        If walking outside, wear layers of clothing so that you can take off a layer if you’re hot, or put one on if too cold.

            Cane/Walker Tips Activity
    -->

    <string name="cane_text1">
        Canes and walkers help people with pain, weakness, and balance problems walk more safely and comfortably. They also
        may help some people avoid falls. There are many types of canes, walkers, crutches and other assistive devices available, so it’s very important to:
    </string>
    <string name="cane_list1">
        <li>work with a healthcare provider (physical therapist, doctor, nurse) to choose the correct type of walking aid for you</li> \n
        <li>have the cane or walker sized so it fits you correctly</li> \n
        <li>get help learning how to use it the right way</li>
    </string>
    <string name="cane_text2">In most cases, canes and walkers are reimbursable through Medicare and other insurers.</string>

    <string name="cane_header1_1">Which Should I Choose?</string>
    <string name="cane_text3">
        If you feel you need a cane or walker, talk to your healthcare provider to make sure you get the
        device that is best for you. When deciding between a cane or walker, discuss the following points
        with your healthcare provider:
    </string>
    <string name="cane_q1">What is the main reason you need the device?</string>
    <string name="cane_q2">How much of your weight does the device need to support?</string>
    <string name="cane_q3">Most common types</string>
    <string name="cane_q4">Other things to think about</string>
    <string name="cane_c1"><li>Arthritis or pain, especially of the
        knees and hips, and on one side</li>\n <li>Mild balance problems</li>\n <li>Injuries to one foot or leg</li></string>
    <string name="cane_c2">You can support up to <b>25%</b> of your weight with a cane.</string>
    <string name="cane_c3">
        <li>Single point canes can help with early balance problems</li>\n
        <li>Four point or “quad” canes add more stability and help even more with balance</li>\n
        <li>Seat canes have small attached seats so you can take a rest while using them</li>
    </string>
    <string name="cane_c4">
        <li>All canes must have a non-skid rubber tip</li>\n
        <li>Curved, rounded, or grip handles help with balance and to lower stress on your hand</li>\n
        <li>Canes are not as stable as walkers</li>
    </string>

    <string name="cane_w1">
        <li>Arthritis or pain, especially of the knees and hips, on both sides</li>\n
        <li>Medium to bad balance and gait problems</li>\n
        <li>General weakness or weakness of both legs</li>
    </string>
    <string name="cane_w2">You can support up to <b>50%</b> of your weight with some walkers.</string>
    <string name="cane_w3">
        <li>Standard walkers need to be picked up to move forward</li>\n
        <li>Front-wheeled walkers don’t need to be picked up, so they take less energy to use</li>\n
        <li>Rolling 4-wheeled walkers give support and come with or without seats and brakes</li>
    </string>
    <string name="cane_w4">
        <li>Walkers should have rubber grips for your hands so they don’t slip</li>\n
        <li>Front-wheeled walkers must have non-skid tips on the back legs</li>\n
        <li>Walkers cannot be used on stairs</li>
    </string>


    <string name="cane_header1_2">How to Get a Proper Fit for Your Cane or Walker</string>
    <string name="cane_textList1">The correct length of a cane or walker is measured from the wrist to the floor.</string>
    <string name="cane_textList2">To measure:</string>
    <string name="cane_textList3">
        <li>Wear your normal shoes.</li>\n
        <li>Let your arm hang loosely at your side.</li>\n
        <li>Ask someone else to measure the distance from your wrist to the floor.</li>
    </string>
    <string name="cane_textList4">
        <li>This measurement should be about equal to the distance from the point where your leg bone fits into the hip socket to the floor.</li>
    </string>
    <string name="cane_textList5">
        <li>Have your cane or walker adjusted so that the tops of it is that same distance from the floor.</li>
    </string>
    <string name="cane_textList6">
        <li>Aluminum canes and most walkers are adjusted by pushing in buttons on each side and sliding the tubing to the new length until the buttons lock in place. </li>\n
        <li>Wood canes can be cut to size.</li>
    </string>
    <string name="cane_textList7">
        <li>Put your hand on the cane or walker handle. If the length is correct, you will notice a 20-degree to 30-degree bend in the elbow.
            (If your upper arm is at 12 o’clock, your hand points to 5 o’clock.)</li>
    </string>
    <string name="cane_textList8">If your cane or walker does not feel right, ask your physician or physical therapist to check the fit.</string>

    <string name="cane_header1_3">5 Steps to Safely Using Your Cane</string>
    <string name="cane_textNum_1">Use the cane on the opposite side of your injury, pain, or weakness (unless your healthcare provider tells you not to).</string>
    <string name="cane_textNum_2">Put all of your weight on your bad leg.</string>
    <string name="cane_textNum_3">Move the cane and your bad leg a comfortable distance forward.</string>
    <string name="cane_textNum_4">With your weight supported on both your cane and your bad leg, step through with your bad leg.</string>
    <string name="cane_textNum_5">Place your cane firmly on the ground before you take a step. Do not place your cane too far ahead of you, or it could slip from under you.</string>

    <string name="cane_header1_4">5 Steps to Safely Using Your Walker</string>
    <string name="cane_textNum_6">Stand with your toes halfway between the front and back tips or wheels. Roll or lift your walker a step’s length ahead of you </string>
    <string name="cane_textNum_7">Place the walker firmly on the ground. Do not place your walker too far ahead of you, or it could slip from under you.</string>
    <string name="cane_textNum_8">Lean slightly forward, and hold the arms of the walker for support.</string>
    <string name="cane_textNum_9">Take a step.</string>
    <string name="cane_textNum_10">Repeat the cycle: Place your walker firmly on the ground (or roll it ahead of you), then take a step.</string>

    <string name="cane_header2_1">Get Non-Skid Rubber Tips for Your Cane or Walker</string>
    <string name="cane_text">Non-skid rubber tips help keep you from slipping. Check tips often and change them if they look worn. These tips are available through your local pharmacy or medical supply store.</string>

        Before you board a plane, train, cruise, or get in your car for a vacation, be sure to check
        out these expert tips and recommendations from the American Geriatrics Society’s Health
        in Aging Foundation. Whether you are traveling overseas or just a short distance from
        home, it is important to plan ahead for your healthcare needs.
    </string>

    <string name="travel_header2_1">Find out if you need to update your vaccinations</string>

    <string name="travel_header2_8">Protect yourself from infection and dehydration</string>

    <string name="travel_text1">
        <b>If you are traveling overseas, you may need certain vaccinations before departing—in some cases, up to 6 weeks before you leave.</b>
        Visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Travelers’ Health website <b>https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/travel-vaccines</b>
        to learn what measures you and your fellow travelers may be required to follow when traveling abroad.
    </string>
    
    <string name="travel_text2">
        <b>Explain your travel plans to your healthcare provider</b>, and discuss any travel precautions you should take. Your provider may ask you to come
        in for a checkup or to get any necessary shots.
    </string>
    
    <string name="travel_text3">
        <b>If you take medications, and will be crossing time zones</b>, ask your healthcare provider whether you should take your medicines at your usual 
        time in your home time zone, or if you should switch to the local time zone. Also ask if any new foods you might eat while traveling could interact 
        with your medications or health conditions.
    </string>
    
    <string name="travel_text4">
        <b>Older adults run a higher-than-average risk of DVT</b>, which happens when blood clots form in your veins and block blood flow, usually in your legs. 
        Sitting still for a long time on an airplane, train, or car can contribute to DVT. But some research shows that wearing “compression stockings” can help 
        prevent this dangerous condition. Also, taking frequent breaks to walk or exercise your legs during a long ride can help protect you from developing DVT. 
        Check with your healthcare provider.
    </string>
    
    <string name="travel_text5">
        <li><b>Make a list of all prescriptions, including over-the-counter medications and supplements you take</b>, including the dose, what time you take the
            medications, and what they are for. Ask your pharmacist or healthcare provider to help you create this list and ask them to review it for accuracy.
            The list should include both generic and brand drug names and the amount of each medication you need to take with you on your trip.</li>\n
        <li><b>Ask your healthcare provider for a list of current medical conditions</b> you have and how they’re being treated.</li>\n
        <li><b>Have your healthcare providers’ contact information</b> in writing as well as for emergency purposes.</li>\n\n
        Having all of this on paper will make it easier for you to get through customs, and easier to get replacement medications if you lose any while traveling.
        Make a copy of these lists. Carry one with you, and keep the other in your suitcase.
    </string>

    <string name="travel_text6">
        <b>Do this with prescription and over-the-counter medicines, and supplements.</b> This will also make your trip through customs easier.
    </string>

    <string name="travel_text7"><b>Pack your medications in your carry-on bag</b> to avoid loss or damage.</string>

    <string name="travel_text8">
        <li><b>Wash your hands or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer</b>, especially after spending time on a crowded plane, train, or bus, and before eating.</li>\n
        <li><b>Use common sense when choosing what to eat and drink.</b> Avoid brushing your teeth with water that isn’t safe to drink. The CDC travel site
            <b>http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/</b> includes country-by-country information on illnesses you can get from food and water and how to avoid them.</li>\n
        <li><b>Drink plenty of water when traveling, especially when going by plane.</b> The air inside planes is dry, so bring a large bottle of water with you
            and drink reguarly even if you do not feel thirsty. Or ask for water every time the flight attendant offers a drink instead of soda or coffee, which can
            dry you out even more.</li>

            Safe Sex Tips Activity
    -->

    <string name="safesex_text">
        Many older adults are remaining or becoming sexually active. This is because of better health among older adults, longer lifespans, more open attitudes 
        toward sexuality, internet dating, and the availability of medications like Viagra and estrogen products. Sex can still be satisfying but will be different 
        from younger years, and might need to be adapted for current age, disability, illness, or surgery-induced body changes. Older adults are more vulnerable to 
        sexually transmitted infections (STIs) than younger adults. Everyone should use safe sex practices.
    </string>
    
    <string name="safesex_header3">Here are 4 tips on having and enjoying safe sex, no matter what your age.</string>

    <string name="safesex_header2_1">Do a background and body check</string>
    <string name="safesex_header2_2">Consider getting tested first</string>
    <string name="safesex_header2_3">Use a condom and lubricant</string>
    <string name="safesex_header2_4">Talk to your healthcare provider</string>

    <string name="safesex_text1">
        Know your partner’s sexual background before having oral, vaginal, or anal sex. All types of sex can spread STIs. Talk about your sexual histories, any past STIs,
        results of STI testing, and whether either of you has ever injected illegal drugs. (Besides sex, HIV/AIDS can also be acquired by sharing syringe needles.)
        Before having sex, check your partner’s penis or vaginal area for sores, abnormal discharges, or odors.
    </string>

    <string name="safesex_text2">
        The best way to protect yourself and your partner is for the two of you to get tested for HIV and other STIs before you start having sex. A person can have an
        STI and not know it because the symptoms are not obvious. And some symptoms of STIs or HIV, such as tiredness, can be mistaken for age-related health problems.
    </string>

    <string name="safesex_text3">
        Use one condom and lubricant every time you have vaginal, oral, or anal sex, including during foreplay, until you know your partner’s sexual history,
        STI status, and are in a sexually exclusive relationship. Using water-based lubricants such as K-Y Jelly and Astroglide is important because they can
        lower the chances of getting a sore or tiny cut on the penis or inside the vagina. These sores and cuts can increase the risk of getting STIs. Do not
        use Vaseline or mineral oil with condoms because it destroys the condom lining. Put the condom on after the penis is erect, leaving a 1/2 inch space
        at the tip. Hold the condom at the base (open end) as you remove it. Do not use the same condom twice. Do not use expired condoms.
    </string>

    <string name="safesex_text4">
        Your healthcare provider can offer additional advice about protecting yourself from STIs and when sex is safe with certain medical conditions such as after
        a heart attack. Your provider can also recommend treatments for common sexual problems such as vaginal dryness and erectile dysfunction (difficulty getting
        an erection, also known as ED). They can also recommend treatments for conditions that can affect your sex life, such as incontinence. \n\n
        Effective treatments for vaginal dryness include over-the-counter moisturizers, lubricants, and prescription estrogen creams, tablets, and rings that you
        insert vaginally. \n\n
        ED increases with age, but it is not always a part of growing older. ED can be due to medical conditions such as heart disease or diabetes or emotional problems
        such as depression, anxiety, and stress. It can also be due to side effects from medications such as antidepressants or high blood pressure drugs, as well as
        alcohol use. \n\n
        Because ED may be the first sign of an underlying medical condition, talk to your healthcare provider if you experience this problem. Medications exist to help
        resolve ED problems. Before using ED medications and over the counter and herbal sex aids, make sure to discuss them with your provider or pharmacist.

            Diabetes Tips Activity
    -->

    <string name="diabetes_header3">Diabetes is a common health problem among older people. More than 40 percent of Americans with diabetes are 65 or older.</string>
    <string name="diabetes_text1">When your body digests food it converts much of it into glucose—a kind of sugar that your cells use for energy.
        Your body also produces a hormone called insulin. Insulin helps you get the right amount of glucose in your bloodstream, which carries it to your cells. 
        When something goes wrong with these processes, the result is diabetes.</string>
    <string name="diabetes_text2">
        <b>What is diabetes?</b> Diabetes develops when the amount of sugar in your blood becomes too high, either because your body doesn’t make enough insulin
        (type 1 diabetes), because your body doesn’t respond to insulin (type 2 diabetes), or both. The extra sugar in your blood can damage parts of your body,
        such as your eyes or kidneys. People with type 1 usually develop diabetes in childhood or as teenagers. Older people are particularly likely to develop
        type 2 diabetes because your body’s ability to manage sugar declines with age. Being overweight can also cause diabetes.</string>
    <string name="diabetes_text3">
        <b>Diabetes can’t be cured but it can be managed.</b> If you have diabetes, you should work closely with your healthcare providers to keep your blood pressure,
        cholesterol, and sugar levels under control.
    </string>
    <string name="diabetes_text4">Here’s some expert advice, from the Health in Aging Foundation, for older adults with diabetes and their caregivers.</string>

    <string name="diabetes_header2_1">Make a plan</string>
    <string name="diabetes_header2_2">Make the most of free Medicare services</string>
    <string name="diabetes_header2_3">Eat smaller portions</string>
    <string name="diabetes_header2_4">Choose whole grain breads, cereals, and pasta</string>
    <string name="diabetes_header2_5">Eat a wide variety of low- calorie produce</string>
    <string name="diabetes_header2_6">Avoid sugary drinks and foods</string>
    <string name="diabetes_header2_7">Get moving</string>
    <string name="diabetes_header2_8">Slim down</string>

    <string name="diabetes_h2text_1">
        <b>Work with your healthcare providers to develop a diabetes treatment plan.</b> For many patients, the diabetes educator is an important member of your
        team who can teach you about the best way to eat and stay active. Medicare will cover a visit to a diabetes educator if you and your healthcare provider
        think that you need this. Your treatment plan should meet your needs <i>and your wishes</i>.
    </string>
    <string name="diabetes_h2text_2">
        <b>If you need more help learning how to keep your diabetes under control</b>, Medicare will cover a visit with a diabetes educator once a year.
        Ask your healthcare provider to give you a referral.
    </string>
    <string name="diabetes_h2text_3"><b>Eating more small meals</b> over the course of the day can help keep your blood sugar levels steadier than eating three large meals.</string>
    <string name="diabetes_h2text_4">
        <b>Whole grains have more fiber, and take longer to digest</b> than white flour and other refined starches. Whole grains, such as whole wheat flour, brown rice,
        oats and barley, can help keep your blood sugar levels steadier.
    </string>
    <string name="diabetes_h2text_5">
        Choose bright or deep-colored fruits and vegetables such as spinach, green or red lettuce, tomatoes, carrots, broccoli, squash, or sweet potatoes. \n
        These foods are better choices than white potatoes or iceberg lettuce.
    </string>
    <string name="diabetes_h2text_6">
        <b>Drink water or unsweetened tea instead of soft drinks</b> or other beverages high in natural or added sugar. \n
        Enjoy fresh fruits for dessert. \n
        Avoid processed and prepared foods. These often contain corn syrup, and are high in fat and salt.

        Talk to your healthcare provider about how to get started if you haven’t been exercising for a while. If your healthcare provider says it is safe,
        start with at least 20 minutes of exercise at least three times a week. If you exercise more often, you’ll see even greater benefits.

    <string name="care_text1">
        <b>As many as 43.5 million Americans care for older parents, grandparents, spouses, and other older adults.</b> Some older adults need only a little assistance,
        such as help with shoveling snow or rides to and from the grocery store. Others need a lot of help with daily activities like eating, bathing, dressing, taking
        medications, and managing money. Over time, some older adults with increasing medical problems often need significant help from caregivers in performing
        activities of basic living.
    </string>
    <string name="care_text2">
        While caring for an older family member can be one of the most rewarding experiences of a lifetime, it can also become stressful at times. 
        This is especially true if the older adult has dementia or needs around-the-clock care. Most caregivers are spouses/partners or adult children. 
        They may have health problems of their own, have children to care for, work outside the home, or all of these. The additional duties of providing 
        care for an older person can lead to excessive physical or emotional fatigue, called “caregiver burnout.”
    </string>
    <string name="care_header3">
        It is important to get help before caregiving becomes overwhelming. If you’re caring for an older adult, the American Geriatrics Society’s Health in 
        Aging Foundation suggests the following:
    </string>

    <string name="care_header2_1">Get information</string>
    <string name="care_header2_2">Help the older adult help themselves</string>
    <string name="care_header2_3">Ask trustworthy family, friends and neighbors for assistance</string>
    <string name="care_header2_4">Take care of yourself, too</string>
    <string name="care_header2_5">Don’t take it personally</string>
    <string name="care_header2_6">Talk about it</string>
    <string name="care_header2_7">Contact professionals and organizations that assist caregivers</string>

    <string name="care_h2_1">
        <b>It’s likely that an older person you care for has multiple health problems.</b> They may take quite a few medications and see several different
        healthcare providers to manage these conditions. This can make managing their care more complicated for you as a caregiver. \n
        It’s helpful to accompany the older adult to their medical appointments to learn about their health problems and how these are likely to change over time.
        As a first step in learning more, HealthinAging.org has a wealth of information on health conditions and needs unique to older adults that can help you be a
        better informed and prepared caregiver.
    </string>
    <string name="care_h2_2">
        <b>You can make it possible for an older person to keep doing certain things</b> independently by doing things as simple as putting a no-slip seat in the shower or
        bathtub; installing “grab bars” in the bathroom and near the bed; moving frequently used items to lower shelves; or getting easy-grip can openers and other utensils.
    </string>
    <string name="care_h2_3">
        <b>Ask family and friends for help, and accept help if it is offered.</b> Explain what needs to be done, but try not to criticize if others don’t care for the
        older person in exactly the same way you would. The important thing is that their needs are getting met.
    </string>
    <string name="care_h2_4">
        <b>Take time to eat well, exercise, and relax and enjoy yourself</b> - these are key to avoiding burnout. Look into “respite” programs to allow yourself a short break.
        Also know the warning signs of depression and get help if needed. (See https://www.healthinaging.org/a-z-topic/depression for more information.)
    </string>
    <string name="care_h2_5">
        <b>If an older person has dementia or other mental or emotional problems</b>, they may get angry or say hurtful things. Remind yourself that this is because of the disease.
        Try not to take it to heart.
    </string>
    <string name="care_h2_6"><b>Talking about your experiences and feelings</b> can make caregiving less stressful. Consider joining a caregiver support group in your area.</string>
    <string name="care_h2_7">
        <b>A wide range of programs, agencies, organizations, and individuals</b> in your community can help you manage the challenges of caring for an older person.
        This assistance may be free, or available at low cost.
