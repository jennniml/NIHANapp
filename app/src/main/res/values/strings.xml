    <string name="walk_header2_1">
        Walking is the most popular form of exercise among older adults and it’s a great choice.
    </string>

    <string name="walk_text1">
        If it’s been a long time since you exercised, you may want to start out slowly. You can start with
        just 5 minutes and build up to the recommended 30 minutes a day. Your goal should be to get up to
        taking 100 steps a minute. Remember, the most important thing is to just get started.
    </string>

    <string name="walk_header3_1">What can walking do for you? </string>

    <string name="walk_list1">
        <li>strengthen muscles</li>\n
        <li>help prevent weight gain</li>\n
        <li>lower risks of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and osteoporosis</li>\n
        <li>improve balance</li>\n
        <li>lower the likelihood of falling</li>
    </string>

    <string name="walk_header1_1">Take These Steps to Get Walking</string>

    <string name="walk_header2_2">Join a walking program or walk with a buddy</string>

    <string name="walk_text2">
        Chances are you’ll stick with a walking program if you have someone to walk with. Some shopping malls or town parks may
        have these programs. The National Institute on Aging’s Go4Life campaign has many resources for walking and other kinds of physical
        activity (https://go4life.nia.nih.gov/).
    </string>

    <string name="walk_header2_3">Wear the right shoes</string>

    <string name="walk_text3">
        Comfortable sneakers work well for most people. If you have foot problems, you may want to look into orthopedic shoes or
        talk to your healthcare provider about how you can continue your walking program.
    </string>

    <string name="walk_header2_4">Don’t let a cane or walker stop you</string>

    <string name="walk_text4">
        It’s OK to use your cane or walker if you already have one. These can improve your balance and help take the load off painful joints.
    </string>

    <string name="walk_header2_5">Aim for the right pace</string>

    <string name="walk_text5">
        Try to walk as fast as you can, but still be able to chat with a friend while walking. Aim to work as hard as you do when you
        climb up the stairs.
    </string>

    <string name="walk_header2_6">Talk to your healthcare provider if you have any problems</string>

    <string name="walk_text6">
        Tell your healthcare provider if you have any pain or problems walking. Otherwise, don’t let a health problem keep you from
        getting started. You may feel a little stiff and achy as you start walking, but many people feel better once they start moving!

    <string name="walk_header1_2">3 Tips for Safe Walking</string>

    <string name="walk_header2_7">Be Aware of Your Surroundings</string>

    <string name="walk_text7">
        Plan to walk during the daytime or in well-lit areas in the evenings. Keep an eye out for uneven surfaces, possible obstacles,
        and other tripping hazards.
    </string>

    <string name="walk_header2_8">Keep Hydrated</string>

    <string name="walk_text8">
        Bring a bottle of water (or other low-calorie liquid) with you and be sure to drink plenty of fluids if you sweat.
    </string>

    <string name="walk_header2_9">Dress Properly for the Weather</string>

    <string name="walk_text9">
        If walking outside, wear layers of clothing so that you can take off a layer if you’re hot, or put one on if too cold.

    -->

    <string name="cane_text1">

    </string>

            <li>get help learning how to use it the right way</li>
        </string>
    <string name="cane_text2">In most cases, canes and walkers are reimbursable through Medicare and other insurers.</string>

    <string name="cane_header1_1">Which Should I Choose?</string>
    <string name="cane_text3">If you feel you need a cane or walker, talk to your healthcare
provider to make sure you get the device that is best for you. When deciding between a cane or
walker, discuss the following points with your healthcare provider:</string>
    <string name="cane_q1">What is the main
    reason you need the
    device?</string>
    <string name="cane_q2">How much of your
    weight does the
    device need to
    support?</string>
    <string name="cane_q3">Most common
    types</string>
    <string name="cane_q4">Other things to
think about</string>
    <string name="cane_c1"><li>Arthritis or pain, especially of the
        knees and hips, and on one side</li>\n <li>Mild balance problems</li>\n <li>Injuries to one foot or leg</li></string>
    <string name="cane_c2">You can support up to <b>25%</b> of your
weight with a cane.</string>
    <string name="cane_c3"><li>Single point canes can help with
        early balance problems</li>\n <li>Four point or “quad” canes add
more stability and help even more
        with balance</li>\n <li>Seat canes have small attached
seats so you can take a rest while
        using them</li></string>
    <string name="cane_c4"><li>All canes must have a non-skid
rubber tip</li>\n<li>Curved, rounded, or grip handles
help with balance and to lower
        stress on your hand</li>\n <li>Canes are not as stable as walkers</li></string>

    <string name="cane_w1"><li>Arthritis or pain, especially of the knees
        and hips, on both sides</li>\n <li>Medium to bad balance and gait
        problems</li>\n <li>General weakness or weakness of both
legs</li></string>
    <string name="cane_w2">You can support up to <b>50%</b> of your weight
with some walkers.</string>
    <string name="cane_w3"><li>Standard walkers need to be picked up
        to move forward</li>\n <li>Front-wheeled walkers don’t need to be
picked up, so they take less energy to
        use</li>\n <li>Rolling 4-wheeled walkers give support
and come with or without seats and
brakes</li></string>
    <string name="cane_w4"><li>Walkers should have rubber grips for
        your hands so they don’t slip</li>\n <li>Front-wheeled walkers must have
        non-skid tips on the back legs</li>\n <li>Walkers cannot be used on stairs</li></string>


    Most common
    types

    <string name="cane_header1_2">How to Get a Proper Fit for Your Cane or Walker</string>
    <string name="cane_textList1">The correct length of a cane or walker is measured from the wrist to the floor.</string>
    <string name="cane_textList2">To measure:</string>
    <string name="cane_textList3">
        <li>Wear your normal shoes.</li>\n
        <li>Let your arm hang loosely at your side.</li>\n
        <li>Ask someone else to measure the distance from your wrist to the floor.</li>
    </string>
    <string name="cane_textList4"><li>This measurement should be about equal to the distance from the point where
    your leg bone fits into the hip socket to the floor.</li></string>
    <string name="cane_textList5"><li>Have your cane or walker adjusted so that the tops of it is that same distance from
    the floor.</li></string>
    <string name="cane_textList6"><li>Aluminum canes and most walkers are adjusted by pushing in buttons on each
    side and sliding the tubing to the new length until the buttons lock in place.
    </li>\n <li>Wood canes can be cut to size.</li></string>
    <string name="cane_textList7"><li>Put your hand on the cane or walker handle. If the length is correct, you will notice
    a 20-degree to 30-degree bend in the elbow. (If your upper arm is at 12 o’clock, your
    hand points to 5 o’clock.)</li></string>
    <string name="cane_textList8">If your cane or walker does not feel right, ask your physician or physical
therapist to check the fit.</string>


    <string name="cane_header1_3">5 Steps to Safely Using Your Cane</string>
<string name="cane_textNum_1">Use the cane on the opposite side
of your injury, pain, or weakness
(unless your healthcare provider
tells you not to).</string>
    <string name="cane_textNum_2">Put all of your weight on your bad
leg.</string>
    <string name="cane_textNum_3">Move the cane and your bad leg a
comfortable distance forward.</string>
    <string name="cane_textNum_4">With your weight supported on
both your cane and your bad leg,
step through with your bad leg.</string>
    <string name="cane_textNum_5">Place your cane firmly on the
ground before you take a step.
Do not place your cane too far
ahead of you, or it could slip
from under you.</string>

    <string name="cane_header1_4">5 Steps to Safely Using Your Walker</string>
<string name="cane_textNum_6">Stand with your toes halfway between
the front and back tips or wheels.
Roll or lift your walker a step’s length
ahead of you
</string>
    <string name="cane_textNum_7">Place the walker firmly on the ground.
Do not place your walker too far
ahead of you, or it could slip from
under you.</string>
    <string name="cane_textNum_8">Lean slightly forward, and hold the
arms of the walker for support.
</string>
    <string name="cane_textNum_9">Take a step.</string>
    <string name="cane_textNum_10">Repeat the cycle: Place your walker
firmly on the ground (or roll it ahead
of you), then take a step.</string>

    <string name="cane_header2_1">Get Non-Skid Rubber Tips
for Your Cane or Walker</string>
    <string name="cane_text">Non-skid rubber tips help keep you from
slipping. Check tips often and change them if
they look worn. These tips are available through
your local pharmacy or medical supply store.</string>
